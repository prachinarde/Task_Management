# AI Task Management System  

I built this AI-powered task management system to help users manage tasks efficiently with **real-time updates**, **AI task suggestions**, and **secure authentication**.  

---

## 📝 Problem Statement  
Managing tasks effectively can be challenging, especially when dealing with multiple priorities. Issues like **poor organization**, **lack of automation**, and **difficulty in tracking progress** often arise.  

To solve this, I developed a full-stack **task management system** that leverages AI to automate task recommendations, WebSockets for real-time updates, and a modern UI for a seamless user experience.  

---

## 💡 My Approach  
I designed a **scalable and efficient** system using:  
- **Golang (Gin) backend** for high-performance APIs.  
- **Next.js (TypeScript) frontend** for a fast and interactive UI.  
- **MongoDB** as the database for structured task storage.  
- **JWT authentication** for secure access control.  
- **WebSockets** for real-time task updates.  
- **AI-powered task suggestions** using OpenAI/Gemini API.  
- **Tailwind CSS** for a sleek, responsive design.

## 🛠 Solution  
### **Backend (Golang + Gin + MongoDB)**  
✅ **Built a REST API** using **Gin** framework for handling task operations.  
✅ **Implemented JWT Authentication** to ensure secure user login & access control.  
✅ **Used MongoDB** for efficient task storage and retrieval.  
✅ **Integrated WebSockets** to provide real-time task updates.  
✅ **Leveraged OpenAI/Gemini API** to generate AI-powered task suggestions.  
✅ **Deployed backend on Render/Fly.io** for scalability.  

### **Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind)**  
✅ **Developed an interactive UI** using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
✅ **Used Redux Toolkit** for global state management.  
✅ **Implemented real-time updates** with WebSockets.  
✅ **Optimized API calls** using Axios and React Query.  
✅ **Added toast notifications** for better user experience.  
✅ **Deployed frontend on Vercel** for fast and reliable hosting.
